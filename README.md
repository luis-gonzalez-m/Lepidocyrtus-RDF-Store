# Lepidocyrtus_RDF_Store
This repository contains files .owl for morphological descriptions of neotropical species of Lepidocyrtus (Collembola:Entomobryidae). The files are canonical ontologies result of generalization on specimens set for each species. This is an alternative approach to Phenex (Balhoff et al. 2010, Balhoff et al. 2013) because it does not need a previous character matrix altough it is class-based method. I am working in this project not free of mistakes. You can check the files and suggest comments. Only you need Protégé editor.

This project is part of doctoral thesis titled "Taxonomic review of genus Lepidocyrtus s.l. Bourlet, 1839 (Collembola: Entomobryomorpha: Entomobryidae) for the Neotropical region and inclusion of ontologies in morphological descriptions".
